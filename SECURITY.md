# Security

This repository follows industry best practices for cryptography to ensure the security of the code and data. The Project is a Proof-of-Concept, not to be used in production. 

## Encryption

Sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit using strong cryptographic algorithms, Post-Quntum. We use industry-standard encryption libraries and protocols to protect data from unauthorised access.

## Key Management

Keys used for encryption are securely generated, stored, and managed. We follow key management best practices to prevent unauthorised access to encryption keys.

## Secure Coding

We adhere to secure coding practices to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities and exploits. We regularly review and update our codebase to address any security issues that may arise.
